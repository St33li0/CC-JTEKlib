Greetings! My name is Jacob A.K.A. St33li0 and I am currently in the process of developing an extensive library for the Computercraft mod in Minecraft, specifically CC\:Tweaked. This library will encompass a wide range of useful and efficient functions that aim to enhance your coding experience. The purpose of this page is to provide a comprehensive overview of the library and its functionalities. Please stay tuned for further updates and developments.
